# 23/8/2017 After spending the last few days figuring how to use github, I have decided to start documenting my Data science journey here.
# I will be attempting to do the exercise in introduction to statistical learning in both python and R. 

#All credits must be given Amir Sadougi - https://github.com/asadoughi who thought of doing the same thing 4 years ago. His solutions are
# invaluable to my journey. On top of what Amir has done, I will try to document my thoughts and explaination to some of these problems.
